The field of data science continues to be one of the most lucrative and dynamic career paths in 2024. As businesses increasingly rely on data-driven decision-making, the demand for skilled data scientists has grown across industries, including technology, finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. However, salary trends in data science are influenced by a variety of factors, such as emerging technologies, economic conditions, geographic location, and skill specialization. This research aims to analyze salary patterns in data science in 2024, providing insights into compensation disparities and growth opportunities within the industry.

This scatter plot compares actual vs. predicted salaries using a linear regression model. The blue dots represent the predictions, while the red dashed line indicates the ideal scenario where predicted salary perfectly matches the actual salary. From the plot, we observe that most predictions are clustered in a narrow range, underestimating high salaries and overestimating lower ones. The model's R² value of 0.0757 indicates it explains only about 7.6% of the variance in salaries, suggesting limited predictive power. The RMSE of 43053.61 further highlights the large average error in predictions. These insights imply that the model struggles to capture the complexity of salary determination and may benefit from including more relevant features, nonlinear modeling, or feature engineering.

It suggests that this cluster centers on professional qualifications, workplace expectations, and the value of skills in data and business environments. Terms related to benefits, insurance, and work-life aspects like "time" and "support" also appear prominently, pointing to both the practical and strategic dimensions of employment.

This word cloud for Cluster 1 revolves around enterprise technology and cloud-based solutions, with strong emphasis on "experience", "oracle", "cloud",  and "architecture". It reflects a technical and strategic domain where roles focus on designing and implementing enterprise systems.  Terms like "solutions",  "technology", and "business" suggest a blend of IT expertise and business alignment, especially in environments involving enterprise resource planning (ERP) and cloud infrastructure.  The presence of "architect",  "technical",  and "functional", points to both high-level system design and hands-on implementation know-how.


Based on the heatmap, we can see that our team displays varied skill levels across multiple technical domains. The strongest skills across the team are SQL, Excel, Python, PowerBI, and R, where most members show advanced (level 4) proficiency. While SAP Applications and Azure are consistently lower across all team members, with most showing only basic knowledge (level 2). 

Three team members (Yuxuan Chen, Shangxuan Zhong, and Qimin Shen) demonstrate particularly strong data-related skills, with advanced proficiency in multiple areas. Altyn Baigaliyeva has a different skill distribution, showing strength in PowerBI and PowerPoint while maintaining intermediate skills in most other areas.
