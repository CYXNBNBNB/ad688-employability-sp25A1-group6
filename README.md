First, we used K-Means clustering with TF-IDF features to group job descriptions into four clusters. Then we made word clouds to see the top keywords in each group.
Cluster 0 is the biggest one. It shows common job words like “experience,” “data,” “business,” and “job.”
Cluster 1 is about cloud systems. Words like “cloud,” “oracle（/ˈɔrəkl）,”  appear a lot.
Cluster 2 focuses on SAP consulting, with words like “SAP,” “consultant,” and “hana.”
Cluster 3 is related to data analytics, with keywords like “data,” “analytics,” and “SQL.”
These word clouds help us quickly understand what each group is mainly about.
