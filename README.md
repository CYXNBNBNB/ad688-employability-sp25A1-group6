First, the box plot "Salary Comparison: Remote vs. On-Site Jobs" shows salaries for On-Site, Hybrid, and Remote jobs. Remote jobs have a slightly higher median salary. On-Site jobs have the widest salary range and the most outliers, meaning pay can change a lot. Hybrid jobs have more stable salaries. This tells us Remote and Hybrid jobs are not paid less â€” they may even offer better pay.
Next, the "Average Salary by State" map shows big differences across the U.S. States like California, Washington, and Colorado have higher salaries, probably because of strong tech industries and high living costs. States like Mississippi and Alabama have lower salaries. New Jersey and Massachusetts also offer good pay because of finance, healthcare, and education jobs.
The bar chart "Top 10 Industries with Highest Salaries" shows the industries that pay the most. The top fields are Cybersecurity, AI, Data Privacy, and Green Jobs. Many jobs mix these areas and pay over $140,000, with some close to $155,000. This shows tech, security, and sustainability skills are in high demand.
