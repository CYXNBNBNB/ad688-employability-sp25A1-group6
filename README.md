tates. High-paying jobs were concentrated in places like California, New York, and Texas—but several mid-cost states also offered strong salaries in the right clusters.

Lastly, we built a multiple linear regression model to predict salary using the same features. After training, the model had a very low R² of 0.0757, meaning it only explained about 7.6% of salary variation. The RMSE was over $43,000, so predictions were not very accurate. This tells us that salary is likely influenced by more complex, possibly nonlinear factors.
