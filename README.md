We performed K-Means clustering on our cleaned job dataset to explore how roles naturally group based on salary, employment type, education level, job duration, remote status, and location.

We first converted numerical and categorical fields into a format the model could understand, then standardized everything to ensure fairness across variables. We tested different numbers of clusters and plotted the SSE for each—this gave us an Elbow chart. While k = 9 had the lowest error, we chose k = 3 for better interpretability. It gave us fewer, more meaningful groups without overcomplicating the analysis.

We then validated our clusters by comparing them with actual employment types using two metrics—Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). These scores confirmed that our clusters aligned reasonably well with real-world labels.
