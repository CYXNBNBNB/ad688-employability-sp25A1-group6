First, the box plot "Salary Comparison: Remote vs. On-Site Jobs" shows salaries for On-Site, Hybrid, and Remote jobs. Remote jobs have a slightly higher median salary. On-Site jobs have the widest salary range and the most outliers, meaning pay can change a lot. Hybrid jobs have more stable salaries. This tells us Remote and Hybrid jobs are not paid less â€” they may even offer better pay.
