Columns to clean contain those string values often wrapped in brackets, double quotes, or cluttered with newlines and extra spaces. For each of these columns, using regular expressions to remove square brackets, line breaks, and excess whitespace, formats comma-separated items with a proper space after each comma, and removes all double quotes, resulting in cleaner, more readable text entries across the specified columns.\n\n\nCode\n# 2.

Imputing numerical fields like salary with the median could distort salary distributions and mask meaningful patterns or outliers. Similarly, replacing missing categorical fields with “Unknown” may introduce noise and reduce the reliability of downstream analysis, especially in modeling or clustering tasks. Additionally, dropping columns with over 50% missing data might lead to the loss of potentially valuable or unique information. By keeping the missing values intact, we allow for more transparent analysis and leave room for context-aware handling in specific use cases.\n\n\n\nThe dataset is overly complex, with more than 100 different variables and columns. Therefore, we have taken the approach of directly extracting a specific column or columns of the data to be analyzed to generate a dataframe and analyze it.

Similarly, replacing missing categorical fields with “Unknown” may introduce noise and reduce the reliability of downstream analysis, especially in modeling or clustering tasks. Additionally, dropping columns with over 50% missing data might lead to the loss of potentially valuable or unique information.
